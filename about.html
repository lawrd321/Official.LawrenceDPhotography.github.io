				<h2>ALL ABOUT ME</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify"> Hey there! I'm Lawrence Christian de Asis, 18 years roaming this life. I've been a 3-year Trailblazer this Academic Year, previously a Spartan on USTP-SHS Department for 2 years. I chose to enroll under CITC - BSIT because it is inlined with my pasion. And I chose particularly, USTP, because it really has the beacon of excellence, the pride of mindanao, and the home of great trailblazers.</p><br>


				<h2>WHAT I LIKE ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY?</h2>

				<p style="text-align: justify">Photography adds so much value to our lives, by recording special events, people, or places, as well as helping us learn and grow as people. It allows me to share my life and experiences in more meaningful ways via images, either online or printed and given as gifts. It also allows me to express my creativity and unique perspective through capturing images, and serves as my creative outlet to showcase my artistic vision and storytelling abilities.</p><br>
				
				<h2>WHY I STARTED PHOTOGRAPHY GIG/BUSINESS?</h2>

				<p style="text-align: justify">I was inspired by the foreign photographers like Brandon Woelfol, Jessica Kobeissi and Irene Rudnyk. Because of them, I also want to experience working with other people. And in that way, I can also build more self-potential and also my social skills. Like any other photographers, I capturing moments, exploring different techniques, and expressing my creativity through sharing one's perspective with the world. It is one of my ways to connect with others, share stories, and create meaningful connections through visual storytelling. And with my great intentions of pursuing a career in photography, it can be a stepping stone towards professional growth and opportunities in the field.</p><br>
				
				<h2>WHAT TYPE OF PHOTOGRAPHY FIELD DO I LIKE THE MOST?</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">In my opinion, I like Portraits the most. It focuses on capturing the essence, personality, and expressions of a person, and showcase the subject's unique features, emotions, and character traits. It involves careful composition, lighting, and posing techniques to create visually appealing and engaging portraits. Overaall, it offers a unique and rewarding experience for both the photographer and the subject, as it combines technical skills, artistic expression, and the ability to capture the essence of individuals, creating images that hold sentimental value and artistic merit.</p>
